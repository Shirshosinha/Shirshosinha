### Mock Interview Platform (UHired.ai)
Designed and implemented an AI-driven mock interview platform (UHired.ai) that simulates personalized technical and behavioral interviews based on user resumes and job roles. 

[Project Link](https://resume-ai-blush.vercel.app/#)
- Integrated real-time computer vision models (OpenVINO) for eye-contact detection during interviews
- Engineered a FastAPI-based backend integrated with OpenAI, OpenVINO, YouTube, and ScrapingDog APIs to generate tailored interview questions, assess user responses, and scrape job listings dynamically.
- Built and managed backend systems handling resume parsing, structured data extraction, session logic, and database interactions (PostgreSQL), with Amazon S3 used for secure file storage.

### AI-Powered Misinformation Detecter (Red-Flag)
Designed a browser extension to combat misinformation and ensure the integrity of online content leveraging AI technologies to detect deepfake videos, check facts in real-time, analyze sentiment for bias detection, and create a community-driven fact-checking ecosystem where users can contribute insights.

[Project Link](https://github.com/Shirshosinha/RedFlag_SCDS_TechFest)
- **Deepfake Detection**: Uses the GenConViT model to detect fake videos across major platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram.
- **Community Fact-Checking**: Enables user discussions and sentiment-based credibility ratings powered by Snowflake Cortex AI.
- **Misinformation Verification**: Cross-checks claims with top news sources using Google Search and Llama3.1 to classify accuracy.
- **Bias Analysis**: Detects and highlights sentiment bias in headlines and article content using RoBERTa.
